## Simple Quiz Game 
Create a multiple-choice quiz with questions about Python, movies, or any fun topic! Display scores at the end and allow the user to play again.

## Weekly Code Challenge!
Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute the sum of all the integers in the list.


Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a for loop to print each book name on a separate line.


Write a program that uses a dictionary to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite color. Ask the user for input and store the information in the dictionary. Then print the dictionary to the console.


Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.


Create a program that stores a list of words. Then, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the words that have an odd number of characters.

# File Handling and Exception handling
File Handling in Python is the ability to perform various operations on files, like reading from and writing to them. Files are used to store data permanently.

File handling in Python allows you to:

Open files in different modes (e.g., read-only or write mode).

Read and write data in a variety of formats.

Close files to free up system resources.

## File Operations in Python
### Opening Files 🔓
Use Python’s open() function to access a file.

Syntax: open(filename, mode), where:

filename: The name of the file you want to work with.

mode: The mode you want to open the file in.

Modes include:

'r': Read mode, used for reading files.

'w': Write mode, creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.

'a': Append mode, adds new content without deleting existing data.

'rb', 'wb': Binary modes for non-text files, like images.

### Reading Files 📜

Python provides multiple ways to read file contents:

.read(): Reads the entire file.

.readline(): Reads a single line at a time.

.readlines(): Reads all lines and returns a list.

### Writing & Appending to Files ✍️

Writing is essential for saving data, like storing a user’s progress or keeping a record.

write(): Overwrites content, while append() allowing adding without deleting.

## Exception Handling
Basic Structure of try-except Blocks ⚙️

try: Runs code that might throw an error.

except: Catches the error, allowing you to respond without crashing.

finally: Runs no matter what, often used to clean up (like closing a file).

## Best Practices 📏
- Use with for file handling: Auto-close files, preventing potential leaks.
- Check file existence before reading/writing, to avoid crashes.
- Handle specific exceptions over general ones (e.g., FileNotFoundError instead of Exception).
- Document error messages clearly for easier debugging and user support.
